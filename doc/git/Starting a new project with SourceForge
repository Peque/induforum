Once you are registered and have your own account, you need to create
a new project. Just go to Create Project and fill the requested
information. After the registration is completed, you can follow
the recommended instructions.

To initialize the repository, first clone the empty repository from
the server:

$ git clone ssh://USERNAME@PROJECTNAME.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/PROJECTNAME/REPONAME

(This will create a folder named "PROJECTNAME" in the current
directory). Then, create a file for the first commit, in example:

$ cd PROJECTNAME
$ gedit README

We can add a short description of the project in that file.
After saving the changes to README, we'll just need to commit them.
But before doing it, we'll configure some personal data (use your
own name and e-mail instead of "my_name" and "my_email@domain";
remember to keep the "" around them!):

$ git config --global user.name "my_name"
$ git config --global user.email "my_email@domain"
$ git config -l	(to check that we correctly entered our data)

Now we are ready to commit the changes:

$ git add README
$ git commit

The last thing we need to do is to push this change to the serer:

$ git push origin master
