<header>
	The header element contains introductory information to a section
	or page. This can involve anything from our normal documents
	headers (branding information) to an entire table of contents.

<nav>
	The nav element is reserved for a section of a document that
	contains links to other pages or links to sections of the same
	page. Not all link groups need to be contained within the <nav>
	element, just primary navigation.

<section>
	The section element represents a generic document or application
	section. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of
	content, typically with a heading, possibly with a footer.
	(It acts much the same way a <div> does by separating off a
	portion of the document)

<article>
	The article element represents a portion of a page which can
	stand alone such as: a blog post, a forum entry, user submitted
	comments or any independent item of content.

<aside>
	Aside, represents content related to the main area of the
	document. This is usually expressed in sidebars that contain
	elements like related posts, tag clouds, etc. They can also be
	used for pull quotes.

<footer>
	The footer element is for marking up the footer of, not only the
	current page, but each section contained in the page. So, it’s
	very likely that you’ll be using the <footer> element multiple
	times within one page.

=====================================================================

The header element represents the header of a section. Headers may
contain more than just the section’s heading—for example it would be
reasonable for the header to include sub headings, version history
information or bylines.

<header>
  <h1>A Preview of HTML 5</h1>
  <p class="byline">By Lachlan Hunt</p>
</header>

<header>
  <h1>Example Blog</h1>
  <h2>Insert tag line here.</h2>
</header>

The footer element represents the footer for the section it applies
to. A footer typically contains information about its section such as
who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the
like.

<footer>© 2007 Example Inc.</footer>

The nav element represents a section of navigation links. It is
suitable for either site navigation or a table of contents.

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/products">Products</a></li>
    <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

The aside element is for content that is tangentially related to the
content around it, and is typically useful for marking up sidebars.

<aside>
  <h1>Archives</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/2007/09/">September 2007</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a></li>
    <li><a href="/2007/07/">July 2007</a></li>
  </ul>

</aside>

The section element represents a generic section of a document or
application, such as a chapter, for example.

<section>
  <h1>Chapter 1: The Period</h1>
  <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
     it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
     it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
     it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
     ...</p>
</section>

(Excerpt from A Tale of Two Cities)

The article element represents an independent section of a document,
page or site. It is suitable for content like news or blog articles,
forum posts or individual comments.

<article id="comment-2">
  <header>
    <h4><a href="#comment-2" rel="bookmark">Comment #2</a>
        by <a href="http://example.com/">Jack O'Niell</a></h4>
    <p><time datetime="2007-08-29T13:58Z">August 29th, 2007 at 13:58</time>
  </header>
  <p>That's another great article!</p>
